		<h1>James P. "Sulley" Sullivan</h1>
		<img src="img/Sulley.jpg" alt="Sulley.jpg">
		<p>Sulley is one of the main characters of Monsters, Inc. Him and his partner Mike Wazowski were the top scare duo at Monsters, Inc., where they use the screams of little children for energy. Though Sulley is large and scary, he has a kind heart and tries to save Boo, a human girl who wandered into their world. He may be one of the best scarers, he still touches all of our hearts with his loving nature.</p>
